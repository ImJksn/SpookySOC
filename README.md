# SpookySOC - Easy Threat Reputation

SpookySOC is designed to allow security practitioners to speed up parts of their workflow, primarily OSINT and reputation analysis.

Currently, users may lookup information for **IPs**, **domains**, and **hashes**.
Users will be able to have this information written to a flat-text file on their system in the future. For now, terminal output is colored for readability.

**By using SpookySOC, you agree to the terms and conditions of the LICENSE, and the terms/conditions/licenses of the services providing the API key.**

**Please see [the changelog](CHANGELOG.md)** for features that are implemented and those that are planned.

## Getting Started

You can find information about getting started on the Wiki, [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20201112172402/https://gitlab.com/jksn/spookySOC/-/wikis/Getting-Started).
* Since I recently moved to GitHub from GitLab, screenshots are broken on the GitHub Wiki. An Archive of the GitLab page is provided for readability. Everything is the same, though.

## Contributing

SpookySOC has been in development for several years in varying forms. As this is its first open-source release, contributions would be very much appreciated!

Please open an issue or create a pull request, I'll work on accepting contributions.
